## Hi There! ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I'm Matthew. I'm currently working as an Enterprise Risk Analyst for an Oil and Gas firm.
I started my own GitHub repository to learn more about data analysis and reporting, query optimization and data modelling! 

Hoping I can get started on some projects as a way to learn more and showcase my skills.
